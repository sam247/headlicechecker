    "heading": "How this head lice checker helps you decide quickly",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Most families do not need a long technical explanation in minute one. They need a clear process that lowers panic and helps them avoid guesswork. This page is designed around that reality: check for likely indicators, understand confidence boundaries, and move to the right next step without delay.",
      "The scan is an evidence-led triage tool, not a diagnosis. It helps you prioritize action when you are trying to separate likely head lice activity from common lookalikes such as dandruff, dry scalp flakes, or product residue. By keeping language practical and non-alarmist, the checker supports calm decisions even when symptoms appear suddenly before school or work.",
      "When a result suggests possible risk, you can move straight to clinic pathways for professional confirmation. When risk appears low or unclear, you receive re-check guidance focused on better image capture and symptom monitoring. That balance matters: it reduces unnecessary treatment while helping households escalate quickly when signs become more consistent."

  "lookFor": {
    "heading": "What to look for: head lice, nits, and lookalikes",

      {
        "title": "Head lice indicators",
        "copy": "Live lice are small moving insects that stay close to the scalp and are often seen near the nape or behind the ears. Confirmed movement and repeat sightings across checks usually increase concern more than one uncertain visual speck."

      {
        "title": "Nits and attached ovals",
        "copy": "Nits are typically oval and fixed to one side of the hair shaft. Unlike loose flakes, they are hard to flick away. Repeatedly seeing attached ovals near the scalp in several sections is a stronger signal than finding one isolated particle."
      },
      {
        "title": "Dandruff and dry scalp overlap",
        "copy": "Dandruff flakes are usually irregular and mobile. They can look similar to nits at a glance, especially in rushed evening checks. If particles slide away easily, the finding is often less consistent with active nit attachment."
      },
      {
        "title": "Scalp irritation and symptom context",
        "copy": "Itching, redness, and restlessness can support concern but are not definitive by themselves. Symptoms should be interpreted together with visual evidence, exposure context, and whether findings repeat over time."

    "paragraphs": [
      "A useful head lice check is not just about detection. It is about making the next action obvious. Families often get stuck between overreacting and waiting too long. This framework is intended to reduce that friction and keep decision quality high.",
      "If results are reassuring and symptoms are mild, a structured monitor-and-recheck approach is usually reasonable. If indicators repeat, symptoms persist, or multiple contacts report issues, move promptly toward professional confirmation. Early escalation in the right cases can shorten disruption for the whole household.",
      "Use the same process each time so you can compare like for like: clear lighting, parted hair, close-up images, and a consistent log of what was observed. Repeatability matters more than a single rushed check."
