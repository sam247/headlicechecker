    "intro": "Head lice symptoms can look subtle at first, especially during the first days of an infestation. Families often notice occasional scratching, sleep disruption, or scalp sensitivity before they clearly see lice or nits. This guide explains which symptoms are common, which signs are often misread, and how to check calmly at home before booking a professional follow-up.",

        "heading": "What symptoms usually appear first",
        "paragraphs": [
          "The most common early symptom is itching, but not everyone feels it immediately. Itching is a reaction to saliva from bites, and that sensitivity builds over time. A child can have lice before persistent itching begins.",
          "Another early sign is repeated scalp touching or rubbing, often around the nape of the neck and behind the ears. Parents may notice restlessness, especially in the evening, before seeing anything obvious in the hair.",
          "Mild redness, scratch marks, or irritation can appear after repeated scratching. These signs alone do not confirm lice, but they are useful prompts for a closer inspection in good light."

        "paragraphs": [
          "Symptom checks are most useful when they are systematic. Start in bright lighting, part hair in small sections, and inspect close to the scalp rather than only surface strands.",
          "Prioritize high-probability zones: behind both ears, around the crown line, and at the nape. These areas are warmer and often show the earliest visible signs.",
          "Use a fine comb and wipe after each pass on a white tissue. This helps separate flakes and debris from potential lice or nits and gives better visual contrast during the check."

        "heading": "Symptoms that are often confused with other scalp issues",
        "paragraphs": [
          "Dandruff and dry scalp can mimic lice symptoms, especially when itching is the only signal. Loose flakes move easily, while nits are attached to one side of the hair shaft and do not flick away.",
          "Irritation from shampoo products, eczema, or seborrheic dermatitis can also cause redness and itch. In these cases, visual evidence is essential before assuming lice treatment is needed.",
          "Because overlap is common, symptom-only decisions can lead to unnecessary treatment. A close photo scan plus professional confirmation usually gives clearer next steps."

          "If school notices indicate recent exposure and symptoms are now present at home, run a same-day check and move to a professional clinic if findings are unclear.",
          "Escalation is also sensible if repeated home checks stay inconclusive while symptoms continue. Timely confirmation prevents delays and reduces spread across close contacts."

          "Avoid panic actions such as repeated harsh treatments without confirmation. A measured workflow is easier for children and improves decision quality for parents.",

          "Symptoms often evolve rather than appearing all at once. Early signs can be intermittent, while persistent itching or sleep-time discomfort may appear later as scalp sensitivity builds. Observing this progression helps families avoid dismissing early warning signs too quickly.",
          "A practical approach is to log when symptoms appear, where irritation is reported, and whether signs are isolated or spreading across household contacts. Pattern tracking over several days provides stronger context than one evening check.",
          "If symptoms intensify despite uncertain visual evidence, escalate promptly. Delayed confirmation can prolong spread and increase stress for children and caregivers."

          "Families can reduce false reassurance by repeating checks in consistent conditions: parted hair, strong light, and close-to-scalp inspection across multiple zones. Combining manual checking with a high-quality scan gives a clearer triage signal.",
