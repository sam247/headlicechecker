The platform combines image-based model output, deterministic rule mapping, and clear safety wording so users can understand what was detected, where it was detected, and what actions to take next.

          "Our screening flow is intended to reduce uncertainty, not to replace a clinician. The main purpose is to help parents decide whether a professional confirmation should be prioritized and to reduce delayed action when multiple risk indicators are visible.",
          "The system works best on close-up scalp photos where hair is parted and lighting is strong. It is not optimized for distant portraits, heavy motion blur, or obstructed views. In low-quality conditions we keep language conservative and encourage a better re-scan.",
          "Outputs are therefore written as indicative guidance. We avoid definitive medical claims and direct users toward qualified clinical support whenever confidence is low, symptoms persist, or findings appear significant."

          "The same prepared image variant used for inference is also used in result rendering. This alignment matters because detection overlays are projected using the source coordinate system, and visual trust depends on marker placement matching the displayed frame.",
          "Preprocessing is intentionally minimal: we do not apply aggressive enhancement pipelines that could alter visual artifacts. Users are encouraged to provide better source captures rather than relying on synthetic sharpening."

          "Class aliases are mapped into standardized labels such as lice and nits. We reject malformed detections, enforce numeric coordinate validation, and apply a minimum confidence floor before items are exposed in UI summaries.",
          "For each accepted detection we retain center coordinates, width, height, raw confidence, and tier assignment. This normalized object powers evidence overlays, counts, summary chips, and analytics instrumentation."

          "When valid detections exist, top-level result labels are determined by the strongest detection class. When detections are absent, fallback logic returns a clear-screening outcome with supportive language and re-check guidance if symptoms continue.",
