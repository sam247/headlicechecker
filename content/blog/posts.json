      "## TL;DR",
      "Head lice aren't just a problem for kids — adults can catch them through close contact. The best way to treat lice is with silicone- or oil-based lotions, or consistent wet combing using a fine comb and conditioner. Repeat treatment after 7–10 days, comb daily to remove eggs, and avoid sharing hair tools or bedding. Lice can't jump, live on pets, or survive for more than two days off the scalp. Early detection and follow-up are key to staying lice-free.",
      "This guide explains how to identify head lice, remove them completely, and prevent them from coming back.",
      "## What Are Head Lice?",
      "Head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) are small parasitic insects that live on the scalp and feed on small amounts of blood. They cannot jump or fly — they crawl from one person to another through direct contact.",
      "Adult lice are about the size of a sesame seed, and their eggs (known as nits) stick firmly to the base of hair shafts near the scalp. A typical infestation includes both live lice and nits, which makes regular detection and treatment important.",
      "Quick facts:",
      "• Lice live roughly 30 days on the scalp.",
      "• Eggs hatch in about 7–10 days.",
      "• Lice die within 1–2 days away from a human host.",
      "## Can Adults Get Head Lice?",
      "Yes — absolutely. Adults often catch lice from children or people they live or work closely with.",
      "Common sources of adult head lice include:",
      "• Close contact with infested children or partners",
      "• Schools, nurseries, or childcare environments",
      "• Sharing brushes, combs, hats, or bedding",
      "• Sleeping close to someone with lice",
      "Lice spread mainly through head-to-head contact, not from furniture, carpets, or pets.",
      "## Signs and Symptoms of Head Lice",
      "The most common symptom is an itchy scalp, usually caused by an allergic reaction to louse saliva. However, it can take weeks for itching to start, meaning infestations often go unnoticed at first.",
      "Other signs include:",
      "• Crawling or tickling sensations on the scalp",
      "• Red bumps or irritation behind the ears or at the neckline",
      "• White or yellowish eggs (nits) attached firmly to hair strands",
      "• Difficulty sleeping, as lice are more active at night",
      "If you're unsure, perform a quick check with a fine-toothed comb on damp hair — or use a free <a href=\"/\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">head lice check</a> to get an indicative result.",
      "## How to Check for Head Lice",
      "The most reliable method is wet combing — simple, safe, and inexpensive.",
      "You'll need:",
      "• Conditioner or lubricant spray",
      "• A fine-toothed lice detection comb",
      "• Bright lighting and a paper towel",
      "Step-by-step:",
      "1. Wash and condition your hair, leaving it damp and slippery.",
      "2. Divide hair into small sections.",
      "3. Comb from the scalp through to the ends.",
      "4. Wipe the comb on a paper towel and check for lice or eggs.",
      "Even one live louse means treatment is needed.",
      "## Best Head Lice Treatments for Adults",
      "There are two main treatment options: chemical-free physical treatments and manual removal. Success depends on using them consistently and as directed.",
      "## 1. Silicone- and Oil-Based Lotions or Sprays",
      "These work by suffocating or dehydrating lice rather than poisoning them. They're safe for adults and children and include a range of over-the-counter or pharmacy products. For a proven <a href=\"https://nitnot.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">head lice treatment</a>, look for silicone- or oil-based formulations from trusted brands.",
      "How to use:",
      "• Apply to dry hair, covering the scalp and roots thoroughly.",
      "• Leave on for the time listed in the instructions (usually 10–60 minutes).",
      "• Rinse and comb out dead lice and eggs.",
      "• Repeat after 7 days to kill new lice hatched from remaining eggs.",
      "These modern, non-insecticide formulations are effective and gentle on hair and skin.",
      "## 2. Wet Combing (The \"Bug Busting\" Method)",
      "A completely natural option that requires no chemicals.",
      "What to do:",
      "• Apply conditioner to wet hair.",
      "• Use a fine comb to remove lice and eggs systematically from roots to ends.",
      "• Comb every few days for two weeks.",
      "• Continue until no lice are found for at least two consecutive sessions.",
      "This method is ideal for pregnant or breastfeeding adults, or those who prefer natural solutions.",
      "## Do You Need to Treat Everyone?",
      "Only treat people who have confirmed lice, but everyone in close contact should be checked. If more than one person is infested, treat them all at the same time to prevent reinfestation.",
      "## How to Remove Nits After Treatment",
      "Even after successful treatment, eggs often remain attached to hair. Removing them helps prevent confusion and improves results.",
      "Nit removal tips:",
      "• Use a fine metal comb daily on damp, conditioned hair.",
      "• Use a vinegar-based rinse or nit removal solution to loosen the glue.",
      "• Snip out stubborn hairs with visible eggs if needed.",
      "• Be consistent for 7–10 days after treatment to stop new lice from hatching.",
      "## How to Prevent Head Lice Reinfestation",
      "Lice can return if even one survives or reattaches from another person. Preventive strategies include:",
      "• Avoiding head-to-head contact during outbreaks.",
      "• Not sharing combs, hats, or towels.",
      "• Cleaning brushes and combs in hot water after each use.",
      "• Keeping long hair tied back during close activities.",
      "• Checking hair weekly, especially if you work around children.",
      "There's no guaranteed spray or shampoo that prevents lice — routine checking is still the best defence.",
      "## Common Myths About Head Lice",
      "Misinformation about lice can make people anxious or delay effective treatment. Here are a few common myths debunked:",
      "• \"Lice prefer dirty hair.\" False — lice feed on blood, not oil or dirt. They survive equally well on clean hair.",
      "• \"You can catch lice from pets.\" False — human lice only live on humans.",
      "• \"Lice can jump or fly.\" False — lice crawl only from one head to another.",
      "• \"Short hair or shaving stops lice.\" Not necessarily. Lice can cling to very short hair as long as they can reach the scalp.",
      "• \"Home remedies like mayonnaise or tea tree oil work instantly.\" Some may help, but most are inconsistent compared with proven formulations.",
      "## When to Seek Medical Advice",
      "Most lice cases clear up with standard at-home treatment, but consult a doctor or pharmacist if:",
      "• Lice persist after two complete treatments.",
      "• The scalp becomes infected or sore.",
      "• You are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have sensitive skin.",
      "• Someone in your household keeps getting reinfested.",
      "Medical professionals can recommend alternate products or assess potential resistance. If you prefer professional removal, book a <a href=\"https://nitnotclinic.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">head lice clinic</a> appointment for expert help. You can also find a <a href=\"/find-clinics\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">clinic</a> near you.",
      "## Head Lice Treatment Tips for Different Hair Types",
      "Lice can live in any hair texture or length, but your approach may vary:",
      "• Colour-treated or bleached hair: Use silicone-based products that won't strip colour.",
      "• Curly or Afro-textured hair: Detangle gently before combing to avoid breakage.",
      "• Hair extensions or weaves: Focus on the scalp area; professional removal may help if infestation persists.",
      "• Beards or body hair: Lice rarely migrate beyond the scalp, but check areas behind the ears and neckline.",
      "## Are Lice Becoming Resistant?",
      "Some older insecticide-based products have become less effective due to louse resistance over time. Fortunately, most modern treatments—especially silicone or oil-based formulas—work by physical action, so resistance is extremely unlikely.",
      "If treatment fails, it's usually because lice or eggs were missed, or the treatment wasn't repeated correctly after seven days. Always follow the instructions exactly.",
      "## The Emotional Side of Having Lice",
      "Head lice can feel embarrassing, even for adults. But there's no reason to feel shame — lice are common and simply a result of close human contact, not hygiene or lifestyle.",
      "Approach it calmly, treat promptly, and let anyone close to you know so they can check early. The sooner you treat, the faster you break the cycle.",
      "## Step-by-Step Action Plan",
      "Here's a quick recap of the most effective lice removal routine:",
      "1. Check for live lice using a wet comb.",
      "2. Choose a lice treatment (chemical-free or over-the-counter product).",
      "3. Treat all confirmed cases at the same time.",
      "4. Repeat after 7–10 days to kill any new hatchlings.",
      "5. Remove eggs using a fine metal comb daily.",
      "6. Wash pillowcases, combs, and hair accessories in hot water.",
      "7. Recheck weekly to ensure complete clearance.",
      "Following these steps carefully prevents reinfestation and keeps lice from spreading again.",
      "## Where to Buy Head Lice Treatments",
      "Head lice products are widely available from:",
      "• Local pharmacies and drugstores",
      "• Supermarkets and health stores",
      "• Online marketplaces like Amazon or regional retailers",
      "Look for verified, non-toxic formulations and fine metal dentistry-grade combs for best results.",
      "Adult head lice are extremely common and easy to treat with the right approach. The key is early detection, consistent treatment, and regular follow-up combing.",
      "With safe, over-the-counter products and a little patience, you can get rid of lice for good — and stop them from spreading to others."

    "body": [
      "## TL;DR",
      "The first signs of head lice often include an itchy scalp, a crawling or tickling feeling, and tiny white or yellow eggs (nits) stuck to hair near the scalp. Some people won't itch for weeks, making it easy to miss early infestations. Checking with a fine-toothed comb on damp hair is the most reliable way to confirm lice early. The sooner you detect them, the easier they are to treat.",
      "## Why Early Detection Matters",
      "Head lice are small, fast-moving insects that feed on blood from the scalp. They're not dangerous, but early detection helps prevent them spreading through families or classrooms.",
      "Because lice multiply quickly — females can lay up to eight eggs a day — spotting the first warning signs can save you from a full-blown infestation within weeks.",
      "## What Are Head Lice?",
      "Head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) are wingless parasites that live among human hair, feeding exclusively on blood from the scalp.",
      "Size: About 2–3 mm (similar to a sesame seed).",
      "Colour: Light brown, grey, or transparent until they feed.",
      "Eggs (nits): Tiny white or yellow ovals that attach firmly to the base of hair shafts.",
      "Lice cannot hop, jump, or fly — they crawl between heads, mainly through direct contact.",
      "## The First Signs and Symptoms of Head Lice",
      "Although the symptoms can vary from one person to another, here are the most common early signs you should look for in both <a href=\"https://headlicechecker.com/blog/head-lice-treatment-for-adults\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">adults</a> and children:",
      "## 1. Itchy Scalp",
      "An irritated, itchy scalp — particularly around the neck or behind the ears — is one of the first signs of lice. The itching is caused by an allergic reaction to louse saliva.",
      "However, this may not appear for up to 2–4 weeks after the first contact, so some people carry lice without realising it.",
      "## 2. Crawling or Tickling Sensation",
      "A feeling that something is moving through your hair, especially at night when lice are more active, is a strong clue.",
      "If you feel an occasional tickle or movement without an obvious cause, check as soon as possible.",
      "## 3. Visible Nits (Eggs)",
      "Nits look like tiny white or yellow grains attached firmly to hair strands. They're often found near the scalp, where warmth helps them hatch.",
      "Unlike dandruff or hair product residue, nits don't brush away easily. If you spot them close to the roots, you're likely seeing eggs waiting to hatch.",
      "## 4. Red Spots or Rash on the Scalp",
      "Continuous scratching can cause small red marks or scabs, commonly around the neckline, temples, or ears. These areas are favourite hiding spots for adult lice because they stay warm and moist.",
      "## 5. Difficulty Sleeping",
      "Lice move most actively in the dark. Their movement might cause mild irritation or an itchy feeling that disrupts sleep — particularly noticeable in children.",
      "## 6. Irritability or Restlessness (in Children)",
      "Young children often can't explain why they feel uncomfortable. If your child scratches their head more than usual, appears distracted, or rubs behind their ears often, it's worth checking for lice.",
      "## What Nits Look Like Up Close",
      "Distinguishing between lice eggs and dandruff can be tricky. Here's how to tell the difference:",
      "Feature | Lice Eggs (Nits) | Dandruff or Debris",
      "Attachment | Firmly stuck to hair shaft | Loose, flakes off easily",
      "Colour | White, yellow, or light brown | White or grey",
      "Shape | Oval, about 0.8 mm long | Irregular and flat",
      "Position | Near scalp (within 1 cm) | Anywhere along hair strands",
      "If you find oval particles that stay put even when brushed, they are likely nits.",
      "## How to Confirm a Lice Infestation Early",
      "Even if you notice symptoms, the best way to confirm lice is through a wet-combing check.",
      "You'll need:",
      "• A fine-toothed lice comb (preferably metal)",
      "• Hair conditioner",
      "• Good lighting and tissue or paper towel",
      "Steps:",
      "1. Apply generous conditioner to damp hair to trap lice and slow their movement.",
      "2. Divide hair into small sections.",
      "3. Comb slowly from roots to ends, wiping the comb after each stroke.",
      "4. Examine the tissue for live lice or eggs.",
      "Finding even one live louse confirms infestation and means it's time to treat.",
      "## Why Itching Might Not Start Straight Away",
      "Many people assume you'll feel itchy right away—but that's not always true. You only start itching once your scalp becomes sensitive to louse saliva, which can take weeks.",
      "This delay often causes lice to spread silently between people before symptoms appear, which is why regular checks are so important — especially for families or classrooms.",
      "## What to Do When You Spot the First Signs",
      "If you suspect head lice:",
      "• Confirm with a wet-comb test.",
      "• Treat promptly using a reliable lice lotion, spray, or combing routine.",
      "• Repeat the treatment after 7–10 days to remove new hatchlings.",
      "• Comb daily to remove eggs and ensure complete clearance.",
      "• Check everyone in close contact (family, roommates, partners).",
      "Lice rarely spread from furniture or clothing, but it's still smart to wash pillowcases, hair accessories, and brushes in hot water.",
      "## When to Be Extra Cautious",
      "Certain environments increase your chance of catching lice, even as an adult. Be proactive if you:",
      "• Live with school-aged children",
      "• Work in education or childcare",
      "• Share bedding or pillows frequently",
      "• Have long hair worn loose around others",
      "Frequent checks prevent lice from turning into a recurring problem.",
      "## Myths About Early Head Lice Symptoms",
      "Let's separate facts from fiction so you don't waste time on ineffective fixes:",
      "Myth: Lice only live in dirty hair.",
      "Truth: Clean and dirty hair are equally at risk.",
      "Myth: You can catch lice from pets.",
      "Truth: Lice survive only on human scalps.",
      "Myth: Itching means dirt or product buildup.",
      "Truth: Itching from lice has a distinct tickly sensation that worsens at night.",
      "Myth: You'll always see lice crawling.",
      "Truth: They move fast and are tiny — most people never see them without focused combing.",
      "## How to Prevent Further Spread",
      "Once lice are detected and treated, prevent reinfestation by:",
      "• Checking everyone in the household every few days.",
      "• Avoiding head-to-head contact while hugging or playing.",
      "• Not sharing hats, combs, headphones, or towels.",
      "• Cleaning combs in hot water after every use.",
      "• Keeping long hair tied or braided during close contact.",
      "There's no proven shampoo or spray that stops lice from returning, but vigilance works better than any product.",
      "## When to Seek Professional Help",
      "See a healthcare professional if:",
      "• You've completed two treatments and still find live lice.",
      "• The scalp becomes sore, red, or infected.",
      "• You experience skin irritation or allergic reaction to a treatment.",
      "• You're pregnant, breastfeeding, or treating infants.",
      "A doctor or pharmacist can suggest safe alternatives or additional care for severe cases. You can find a <a href=\"/find-clinics\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">clinic</a> near you for in-person checks.",
      "## Quick Recap: The First Warning Signs Checklist",
      "Here's a simple checklist to help you remember the early indicators:",
      "• Persistent itching on the scalp",
      "• Crawling or tickling feeling",
      "• Nits (white/yellow egg cases) close to scalp",
      "• Redness or small sores from scratching",
      "• Irritability or sleep disruption",
      "• Confirmed lice on a wet comb",
      "Spotting even one of these signs early allows you to start treatment before lice spread further.",
      "## Where to Find Reliable Lice Treatments and Combs",
      "You can buy lice removal products and fine metal combs online or from local pharmacies and supermarkets. Choose pesticide-free, silicone- or oil-based options, and always follow product directions carefully to ensure effectiveness.",
      "The first signs of head lice are subtle but easy to miss — especially before itching begins. By checking regularly and acting quickly, you can stop lice from spreading and make treatment faster and simpler.",
      "Remember: early detection is your best defence. A quick <a href=\"/\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">check for lice</a> now can save you weeks of discomfort later."

    "body": [
      "## TL;DR",
      "If you're dealing with head lice but have sensitive skin or allergies, skip harsh chemical treatments. The best choice is NitNOT Head Lice Treatment, a non‑toxic, eco‑friendly formula that's gentle yet highly effective. It uses natural, odour‑free ingredients to suffocate lice and their eggs without irritation. Other sensitive‑skin‑safe options include silicone‑based sprays like Hedrin, Nyda, or Lyclear, all of which are pesticide‑free and dermatologically tested. For ongoing prevention, regular wet‑combing paired with a fine metal comb works safely for all skin types. Use a free <a href=\"/\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">check for lice</a> to confirm an infestation before treating.",
      "## Why Sensitive Skin Needs a Gentler Solution",
      "People with sensitive scalps or skin conditions like eczema, dermatitis, or psoriasis often react badly to traditional lice treatments. Many older products contained pesticides or strong solvents that could cause redness, itchiness, or burning sensations — especially on already irritated skin.",
      "The good news? Modern head lice treatments now rely on physical action rather than chemical toxicity, making them far gentler and safer. If you suffer from irritation, fragrance sensitivity, or allergies, choosing the right formula is essential for comfort and safety.",
      "## How Over‑the‑Counter Lice Treatments Work Today",
      "Most current OTC lice treatments no longer rely on insecticides. Instead, they suffocate or dehydrate lice and nits using silicone‑based or oil‑based ingredients such as dimethicone or mineral oils.",
      "This approach has several benefits:",
      "• No risk of chemical resistance",
      "• Suitable for most adults and children",
      "• Less likely to cause allergic reactions",
      "• Easy to apply and wash out",
      "These modern formulas are a great step forward — but not all are equally gentle on sensitive skin. That's where NitNOT leads the category.",
      "## 1. NitNOT Head Lice Treatment — The Best for Sensitive Skin",
      "NitNOT is widely recognised as one of the safest and most effective eco‑friendly lice treatments available over the counter. It's especially recommended for anyone with sensitive skin, allergies, or a preference for natural ingredients.",
      "## Why NitNOT Stands Out",
      "• Hypoallergenic and fragrance‑free: Designed for sensitive scalps and skin types.",
      "• No toxins or pesticides: 100% free from organophosphates, parabens, preservatives, alcohol, and perfumes.",
      "• Eco‑friendly and vegan: NitNOT formulas are biodegradable and cruelty‑free, aligning with sustainable consumer values.",
      "• Clinically tested: Removes both live lice and eggs through physical suffocation rather than chemical action.",
      "• Odour‑free and non‑greasy: Easy to apply and rinse, with no lingering smell.",
      "## How It Works",
      "NitNOT uses a dual‑action silicone formula that coats and dehydrates lice while loosening eggs' grip on hair shafts. Because it works mechanically rather than chemically, lice cannot develop resistance.",
      "For best results:",
      "1. Apply NitNOT evenly to dry hair, ensuring full scalp coverage.",
      "2. Leave for the recommended time (usually around 10–15 minutes).",
      "3. Rinse thoroughly and follow with a fine metal nit comb.",
      "4. Repeat the process after 7–10 days to catch newly hatched lice.",
      "## Ideal For",
      "• Sensitive or allergy‑prone skin",
      "• Children, pregnant adults, or those seeking natural options",
      "• Ethically conscious families wanting a sustainable product",
      "Verdict: NitNOT delivers professional‑level effectiveness with zero harsh chemicals — earning the top spot on our list.",
      "## 2. Hedrin All‑in‑One Lice Treatment",
      "Hedrin is another trusted name in lice care and a common pharmacy staple across many countries. Its dimethicone‑based formula works by suffocating lice instead of poisoning them.",
      "## Key Features",
      "• Free from traditional insecticides.",
      "• Light formula that's easy to spread through thick hair.",
      "• Minimal chance of irritation compared with chemical shampoos.",
      "• Some variants contain \"Activdiol,\" a physical mode of action ingredient that breaks down louse structures.",
      "## Considerations for Sensitive Skin",
      "While generally safe, certain Hedrin products include fragrance or alcohol — mild irritants for very reactive scalps. If you're prone to sensitivity, stick to Hedrin Treat & Go or their All‑in‑One Spray Gel, which are among the gentlest versions.",
      "Verdict: A reliable and widely available option for mild sensitivity, but NitNOT remains the better choice for severe reactions or allergy‑prone users.",
      "## 3. Lyclear Sensitive",
      "Lyclear Sensitive is formulated specifically for delicate scalps and is often recommended for younger users or people with mild skin issues.",
      "## Why It Works for Sensitive Skin",
      "• Uses oxyphthirine, a mineral‑oil‑derived compound that kills lice by asphyxiation.",
      "• Gentle, fragrance‑free, and free of pesticides.",
      "• Clinically proven to kill lice and loosen eggs after just one treatment.",
      "## Best Use",
      "Apply to dry hair and leave overnight (for at least 8 hours).",
      "Wash out with shampoo and use a fine lice comb to remove dead lice and nits.",
      "Verdict: Excellent overnight treatment option that suits those who want minimal effort with high efficacy and softness on the scalp.",
      "## 4. Nyda Express",
      "Nyda Express is another dimethicone‑based treatment with a reputation for speed and skin friendliness.",
      "## Key Traits",
      "• Works in about 10 minutes, making it convenient for busy users.",
      "• Free from fragrances, colourants, and preservatives.",
      "• Clinically proven to eliminate lice and nits by blocking their air supply.",
      "While Nyda is generally safe for sensitive skin, some users report mild dryness after frequent use — a common side effect of silicone‑heavy products.",
      "Verdict: Fast‑acting and gentle, though not as eco‑conscious or natural as NitNOT.",
      "## 5. Full Marks Solution",
      "Full Marks uses a similar dimethicone‑based approach but comes in both spray and solution formats.",
      "## Highlights",
      "• Kills lice by dehydrating them.",
      "• Acts within 10 minutes.",

      "## Why Choose Eco‑Friendly or Non‑Toxic Treatments",
      "For sensitive skin users, the benefits of eco‑friendly, hypoallergenic formulations go far beyond comfort:",
      "• Reduced skin flare‑ups: No alcohols, acids, or parabens.",
      "• Safer for children and pets: Low‑toxicity formulas won't harm when used properly. For <a href=\"/for-schools\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">kids</a> in school, gentle products reduce the risk of reactions.",
      "• Better for the environment: NitNOT and other green products biodegrade safely in water.",
      "• No resistance risk: Because these treatments suffocate lice instead of poisoning them, they remain effective long‑term.",
      "By switching to eco‑conscious solutions like NitNOT, you're protecting both your scalp and the planet.",
      "## Extra Tips for Treating Lice on Sensitive Skin",
      "## Do a Patch Test First",
      "Apply a small amount of product to the neck or behind the ear. Wait 12–24 hours before full application to ensure no reaction.",
      "## Use a Gentle Metal Nit Comb",
      "Always comb after treatment to remove eggs. Choose a smooth‑tipped nit comb to prevent scalp abrasion.",
      "## Avoid Scratching",
      "Scratching can worsen irritation and introduce infection. Try using a soothing scalp serum or aloe gel if the area feels itchy after treatment.",
      "## Condition After Treatment",
      "Sensitive scalps can dry out easily. Use a mild, fragrance‑free conditioner afterward.",
      "## Repeat After 7–10 Days",
      "Even gentle treatments need a follow‑up round to kill newly hatched lice.",
      "## When to Seek Medical Help",
      "If your skin reacts severely to any OTC product — redness, swelling, or burning sensations — rinse thoroughly and consult a healthcare provider. You may have a contact allergy and need a specific prescription‑grade alternative.",
      "Additionally, if lice return within two weeks despite correct use, a professional may check for treatment resistance or underlying skin conditions.",
      "## Natural Alternatives for Extra‑Sensitive Users",
      "If you prefer fully natural approaches, you can combine wet combing with plant‑based oils such as:",
      "• Coconut oil (helps smother lice and soothe skin)",
      "• Mineral oil (provides slip and suffocation effect)",
      "• Aloe vera gel (calms irritation post‑treatment)",
      "These remedies are less powerful than formulated treatments but suitable for maintenance care or prevention between treatments.",
      "## Step‑by‑Step Routine for Sensitive Skin Lice Removal",
      "1. Confirm lice with a fine detection comb.",
      "2. Choose a gentle, non‑toxic treatment (NitNOT recommended).",
      "3. Apply evenly to dry hair, massaging gently into the scalp.",
      "4. Leave for the advised time.",
      "5. Rinse thoroughly and condition.",
      "6. Comb meticulously to remove nits and eggs.",
      "7. Repeat after 7–10 days to ensure complete elimination.",
      "8. Optional: use soothing, fragrance‑free care products afterwards to calm irritation.",
      "## Final Verdict",
      "For anyone with sensitive skin, NitNOT remains the gold standard in safe, eco‑friendly head lice treatments. Its hypoallergenic, fragrance‑free, and cruelty‑free design offers both effectiveness and peace of mind.",
      "While Hedrin, Lyclear, Nyda, and Full Marks all perform well for general users, NitNOT combines power, safety, and environmental responsibility in one bottle — making it the best over‑the‑counter lice treatment available today.",
      "If you're ready to tackle lice without harsh chemicals or irritation, NitNOT is the clear winner for comfort, sustainability, and results.
