      "## TL;DR",
      "Head lice aren't just a problem for kids — adults can catch them through close contact. The best way to treat lice is with silicone- or oil-based lotions, or consistent wet combing using a fine comb and conditioner. Repeat treatment after 7–10 days, comb daily to remove eggs, and avoid sharing hair tools or bedding. Lice can't jump, live on pets, or survive for more than two days off the scalp. Early detection and follow-up are key to staying lice-free.",
      "This guide explains how to identify head lice, remove them completely, and prevent them from coming back.",
      "## What Are Head Lice?",
      "Head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) are small parasitic insects that live on the scalp and feed on small amounts of blood. They cannot jump or fly — they crawl from one person to another through direct contact.",
      "Adult lice are about the size of a sesame seed, and their eggs (known as nits) stick firmly to the base of hair shafts near the scalp. A typical infestation includes both live lice and nits, which makes regular detection and treatment important.",
      "Quick facts:",
      "• Lice live roughly 30 days on the scalp.",
      "• Eggs hatch in about 7–10 days.",
      "• Lice die within 1–2 days away from a human host.",
      "## Can Adults Get Head Lice?",
      "Yes — absolutely. Adults often catch lice from children or people they live or work closely with.",
      "Common sources of adult head lice include:",
      "• Close contact with infested children or partners",
      "• Schools, nurseries, or childcare environments",
      "• Sharing brushes, combs, hats, or bedding",
      "• Sleeping close to someone with lice",
      "Lice spread mainly through head-to-head contact, not from furniture, carpets, or pets.",
      "## Signs and Symptoms of Head Lice",
      "The most common symptom is an itchy scalp, usually caused by an allergic reaction to louse saliva. However, it can take weeks for itching to start, meaning infestations often go unnoticed at first.",
      "Other signs include:",
      "• Crawling or tickling sensations on the scalp",
      "• Red bumps or irritation behind the ears or at the neckline",
      "• White or yellowish eggs (nits) attached firmly to hair strands",
      "• Difficulty sleeping, as lice are more active at night",
      "If you're unsure, perform a quick check with a fine-toothed comb on damp hair — or use a free <a href=\"/\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">head lice check</a> to get an indicative result.",
      "## How to Check for Head Lice",
      "The most reliable method is wet combing — simple, safe, and inexpensive.",
      "You'll need:",
      "• Conditioner or lubricant spray",
      "• A fine-toothed lice detection comb",
      "• Bright lighting and a paper towel",
      "Step-by-step:",
      "1. Wash and condition your hair, leaving it damp and slippery.",
      "2. Divide hair into small sections.",
      "3. Comb from the scalp through to the ends.",
      "4. Wipe the comb on a paper towel and check for lice or eggs.",
      "Even one live louse means treatment is needed.",
      "## Best Head Lice Treatments for Adults",
      "There are two main treatment options: chemical-free physical treatments and manual removal. Success depends on using them consistently and as directed.",
      "## 1. Silicone- and Oil-Based Lotions or Sprays",
      "These work by suffocating or dehydrating lice rather than poisoning them. They're safe for adults and children and include a range of over-the-counter or pharmacy products. For a proven <a href=\"https://nitnot.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">head lice treatment</a>, look for silicone- or oil-based formulations from trusted brands.",
      "How to use:",
      "• Apply to dry hair, covering the scalp and roots thoroughly.",
      "• Leave on for the time listed in the instructions (usually 10–60 minutes).",
      "• Rinse and comb out dead lice and eggs.",
      "• Repeat after 7 days to kill new lice hatched from remaining eggs.",
      "These modern, non-insecticide formulations are effective and gentle on hair and skin.",
      "## 2. Wet Combing (The \"Bug Busting\" Method)",
      "A completely natural option that requires no chemicals.",
      "What to do:",
      "• Apply conditioner to wet hair.",
      "• Use a fine comb to remove lice and eggs systematically from roots to ends.",
      "• Comb every few days for two weeks.",
      "• Continue until no lice are found for at least two consecutive sessions.",
      "This method is ideal for pregnant or breastfeeding adults, or those who prefer natural solutions.",
      "## Do You Need to Treat Everyone?",
      "Only treat people who have confirmed lice, but everyone in close contact should be checked. If more than one person is infested, treat them all at the same time to prevent reinfestation.",
      "## How to Remove Nits After Treatment",
      "Even after successful treatment, eggs often remain attached to hair. Removing them helps prevent confusion and improves results.",
      "Nit removal tips:",
      "• Use a fine metal comb daily on damp, conditioned hair.",
      "• Use a vinegar-based rinse or nit removal solution to loosen the glue.",
      "• Snip out stubborn hairs with visible eggs if needed.",
      "• Be consistent for 7–10 days after treatment to stop new lice from hatching.",
      "## How to Prevent Head Lice Reinfestation",
      "Lice can return if even one survives or reattaches from another person. Preventive strategies include:",
      "Avoiding head-to-head contact during outbreaks.",
      "Not sharing combs, hats, or towels.",
      "Cleaning brushes and combs in hot water after each use.",
      "Keeping long hair tied back during close activities.",
      "Checking hair weekly, especially if you work around children.",
      "There's no guaranteed spray or shampoo that prevents lice — routine checking is still the best defence.",
      "## Common Myths About Head Lice",
      "Misinformation about lice can make people anxious or delay effective treatment. Here are a few common myths debunked:",
      "• \"Lice prefer dirty hair.\" False — lice feed on blood, not oil or dirt. They survive equally well on clean hair.",
      "• \"You can catch lice from pets.\" False — human lice only live on humans.",
      "• \"Lice can jump or fly.\" False — lice crawl only from one head to another.",
      "• \"Short hair or shaving stops lice.\" Not necessarily. Lice can cling to very short hair as long as they can reach the scalp.",
      "• \"Home remedies like mayonnaise or tea tree oil work instantly.\" Some may help, but most are inconsistent compared with proven formulations.",
      "## When to Seek Medical Advice",
      "Most lice cases clear up with standard at-home treatment, but consult a doctor or pharmacist if:",
      "• Lice persist after two complete treatments.",
      "• The scalp becomes infected or sore.",
      "• You are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have sensitive skin.",
      "• Someone in your household keeps getting reinfested.",
      "Medical professionals can recommend alternate products or assess potential resistance. If you prefer professional removal, book a <a href=\"https://nitnotclinic.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">head lice clinic</a> appointment for expert help.",
      "## Head Lice Treatment Tips for Different Hair Types",
      "Lice can live in any hair texture or length, but your approach may vary:",
      "• Colour-treated or bleached hair: Use silicone-based products that won't strip colour.",
      "• Curly or Afro-textured hair: Detangle gently before combing to avoid breakage.",
      "• Hair extensions or weaves: Focus on the scalp area; professional removal may help if infestation persists.",
      "• Beards or body hair: Lice rarely migrate beyond the scalp, but check areas behind the ears and neckline.",
      "## Are Lice Becoming Resistant?",
      "Some older insecticide-based products have become less effective due to louse resistance over time. Fortunately, most modern treatments—especially silicone or oil-based formulas—work by physical action, so resistance is extremely unlikely.",
      "If treatment fails, it's usually because lice or eggs were missed, or the treatment wasn't repeated correctly after seven days. Always follow the instructions exactly.",
      "## The Emotional Side of Having Lice",
      "Head lice can feel embarrassing, even for adults. But there's no reason to feel shame — lice are common and simply a result of close human contact, not hygiene or lifestyle.",
      "Approach it calmly, treat promptly, and let anyone close to you know so they can check early. The sooner you treat, the faster you break the cycle.",
      "## Step-by-Step Action Plan",
      "Here's a quick recap of the most effective lice removal routine:",
      "1. Check for live lice using a wet comb.",
      "2. Choose a lice treatment (chemical-free or over-the-counter product).",
      "3. Treat all confirmed cases at the same time.",
      "4. Repeat after 7–10 days to kill any new hatchlings.",
      "5. Remove eggs using a fine metal comb daily.",
      "6. Wash pillowcases, combs, and hair accessories in hot water.",
      "7. Recheck weekly to ensure complete clearance.",
      "Following these steps carefully prevents reinfestation and keeps lice from spreading again.",
      "## Where to Buy Head Lice Treatments",
      "Head lice products are widely available from:",
      "• Local pharmacies and drugstores",
      "• Supermarkets and health stores",
      "• Online marketplaces like Amazon or regional retailers",
      "Look for verified, non-toxic formulations and fine metal dentistry-grade combs for best results.",
      "Adult head lice are extremely common and easy to treat with the right approach. The key is early detection, consistent treatment, and regular follow-up combing.",
      "With safe, over-the-counter products and a little patience, you can get rid of lice for good — and stop them from spreading to others."
