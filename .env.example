# Recommended: DeepSeek API for scan (classification + explanation in one call). No Python service.
# Get a key at https://platform.deepseek.com — then /api/scan uses vision to classify and explain.
# DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
# DEEPSEEK_API_BASE=https://api.deepseek.com

# Optional: URL of your Python RAM service (legacy). If DEEPSEEK_API_KEY is set, this is skipped.
# RAM_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# If neither is set, /api/scan returns a random stub so the app still works.
