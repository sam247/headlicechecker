# ROBOFLOW_WORKSPACE=your_workspace
# ROBOFLOW_WORKFLOW_ID=your_workflow_id
# Option B: Legacy Detect API – from Roboflow Deploy > Inference API. Use path only: project/version
# (e.g. find-head-lice-instant/1). Model must be Published for Hosted Inference. Not workspace/project/version.
# ROBOFLOW_MODEL_ID=find-head-lice-instant/1
#
# Roboflow Legacy Detect API checklist:
# - ROBOFLOW_MODEL_ID = path only, format project/version (no workspace, no full modern ID).
# - In Roboflow: Deploy → Inference API; confirm version is Published for Hosted Inference.
# - Copy the path from that URL into ROBOFLOW_MODEL_ID in Vercel.
# - API key must have access to this project/version.
# - Request uses Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded with base64 image (already implemented).
# - "Service misconfiguration" → check model ID, Published for Hosted Inference, and API key access.
# - "Forbidden" → API key invalid/expired/wrong workspace, or no access to this project/version; re-copy key from Roboflow.
