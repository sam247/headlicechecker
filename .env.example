# Recommended: DeepSeek API for scan (classification + explanation in one call).
# Get a key at https://platform.deepseek.com — then /api/scan uses vision to classify and explain.
# DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
# DEEPSEEK_API_BASE=https://api.deepseek.com

# Optional: URL of your fine-tuned detection API. If set, called first; expects POST /predict with { image } and returns { label, confidence?, explanation? }.
# DETECTION_API_URL=https://your-model.example.com

# If neither is set, /api/scan returns a random stub so the app still works.
